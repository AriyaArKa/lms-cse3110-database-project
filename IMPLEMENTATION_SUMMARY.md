# LMS Database - SQL Query Display & View Pages Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines all the improvements made to the Learning Management System to display real SQL queries and implement comprehensive view pages.

---

## 1. SQL Query Tooltips on Dashboard Cards

### Location: `index.php`

**Changes Made:**

- Added CSS for SQL tooltips with dark-themed code display
- Implemented hover tooltips on all 8 dashboard statistic cards
- Each card now displays the actual SQL query used to fetch the data

**Cards with SQL Tooltips:**

1. Total Students - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'student'`
2. Total Courses - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM courses`
3. Instructors - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'instructor'`
4. Enrollments - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enrollments`
5. Assignments - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM assignments`
6. Average Course Rating - `SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews`
7. Total Revenue - Complex JOIN with enrollments and courses
8. Administrators - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'admin'`

**Visual Features:**

- Dark code-style tooltip background (#1e293b)
- SQL keywords highlighted in blue
- Auto-show on hover
- Clean animation effects
- Positioned above cards with arrow indicator

---

## 2. SQL Query Tooltips on Other Pages

### Users Page (`users.php`)

- Added SQL tooltips to 4 statistic boxes:
  - Total Users
  - Students count
  - Instructors count
  - Administrators count

### Courses Page (`courses.php`)

- Added SQL tooltips to 3 statistic boxes:
  - Total Courses count
  - Average Price calculation
  - Total Value (sum of all course prices)

**Implementation:**

- Consistent styling across all pages
- Reusable CSS class `.sql-tooltip`
- Info icon indicators on cards

- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Dark-themed code display
- Formatted output

**Used Throughout:**

- Every page displays actual SQL queries used
- Queries shown at bottom of pages in collapsible sections

---

## 6. SQL Concepts Demonstrated

### Basic Queries

- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`
- `COUNT(*)`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- `GROUP BY` with aggregates

### Joins

- `INNER JOIN` - Match records between tables
- `LEFT JOIN` - Include all from left table
- Multiple JOINs - 3-4 table joins common
- Self-joins for hierarchical data

### Advanced Concepts

- `CASE` statements for conditional aggregation
- Subqueries in SELECT clause
- `DISTINCT` for unique counts
- `HAVING` clause for filtered aggregates
- Parameterized queries with `:placeholder`

### Real-World Examples

```sql
-- Revenue calculation with JOIN
SELECT SUM(c.price) as total_revenue
FROM enrollments e
INNER JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id

-- Rating breakdown with CASE
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN rating = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as five_stars,
  SUM(CASE WHEN rating = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as four_stars
FROM reviews

-- Subquery for submission count
SELECT title,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM submissions WHERE assignment_id = a.assignment_id) as count
FROM assignments a
```
