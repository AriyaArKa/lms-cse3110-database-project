# üöÄ Getting Started - 5 Minutes to Demo

## Step 1: Start Your Server (1 minute)

1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
2. Click **Start** next to Apache
3. Click **Start** next to MySQL
4. Wait for green "Running" status

## Step 2: Open Your Project (30 seconds)

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost/lms_db/
```

The database will automatically create if it doesn't exist!

## Step 3: Navigate to SQL Demo (10 seconds)

Click **"SQL Demo"** in the top navigation menu

OR go directly to:

```
http://localhost/lms_db/sql_operations.php
```

## Step 4: Show Your Teacher (3-5 minutes)

### Quick Demo Script:

**"Hi Teacher, I've implemented a complete LMS database demonstrating all SQL features."**

1. **Point to Table of Contents**

   - "As you can see, I have 11 sections covering every SQL feature"

2. **Show One Section** (Pick JOINs or Aggregates)

   - Click a section
   - "Here's an example of [JOIN/Aggregate] operations"
   - Click the SQL button
   - "This is the actual query being executed"
   - Point to the result table
   - "And here are the live results"

3. **Scroll Down**

   - "I have similar demonstrations for:"
   - Views (point)
   - Stored Procedures (point)
   - Functions (point)
   - Triggers (point)

4. **Navigate to Another Page** (Optional)

   - Click "Courses" or "Users"
   - Scroll down
   - "Every page also shows the SQL queries used"
   - Click the SQL button

5. **Wrap Up**
   - "All SQL features are fully implemented and working"
   - "The database includes views, procedures, functions, and triggers"
   - "I have sample data to demonstrate everything"

**Done! ‚úÖ**

## Alternative: Quick Feature Showcase

If teacher wants to see specific features:

### Views

- Go to SQL Demo ‚Üí Section 7
- Show 5 pre-created views
- Demonstrate query results

### Stored Procedures

- Section 8 ‚Üí Show procedure calls
- Explain parameters and logic

### Functions

- Section 9 ‚Üí Show function usage
- Demonstrate grade_letter function

### Triggers

- Section 10 ‚Üí Explain automatic actions
- Show progress auto-update example

### Complex Queries

- Section 2 (JOINs) ‚Üí 4-5 table joins
- Section 5 (Subqueries) ‚Üí Nested queries

## Troubleshooting (Just in Case)

### Problem: Can't access localhost

**Solution**: Make sure XAMPP Apache is running (green light)

### Problem: Database not found

**Solution**: Just refresh the page - it auto-creates!

### Problem: Blank page

**Solution**:

1. Check MySQL is running in XAMPP
2. Check error log in XAMPP control panel

### Problem: SQL not displaying

**Solution**:

1. Make sure you're on the right page
2. Look for the SQL button below the table
3. Click it to expand

## What to Say About Each Feature

### Basic Operations

"I use SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT for filtering and sorting data"

### JOINs

"I implemented INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN across up to 5 tables simultaneously"

### Aggregates

"I use COUNT, AVG, SUM, MAX, and MIN for statistical calculations"

### Views

"I created 5 views to store complex queries as virtual tables"

### Procedures

"I have 4 stored procedures for reusable business logic"

### Functions

"4 custom functions for calculations like grade conversion and revenue"

### Triggers

"5 triggers that automatically execute on INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations"
