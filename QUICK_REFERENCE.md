SELECT c.course_id, c.title, AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating,
       COUNT(e.enrollment_id) as total_enrollments
FROM courses c
INNER JOIN reviews r ON c.course_id = r.course_id
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_id HAVING avg_rating IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
```
